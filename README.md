- On our professional computing unit, we are tasked to create our professional software development portfolio involving entire SDLC process
- by working with 5 people (all in Masters of IT) in the team to create a software 
- Our client was the researchers in the agriculture department
- Tasks performed:
1. Requirements gathering from client (interviews/meetings with client; assessing their current system and process)
2. Developed a short report for requirements which included UML diagrams, inputs-outputs,prefered technologies to use, team distribution of tasks and project management timeline
3. Implemented code base using git, python, flask server together with hardware provided by client (code base is a web app that reads ascii code from both the sensor and GPS tracking device, integrate the data in a local server and read rate from a web app) 
4. Each team member have their code task (my role was to create a few functions on the web app server to display map reading from a json file), also did test cases for those functions
5. Created test cases for quality of software based on the functions created on the web app and server
6. Created individual code documentation for both code and test cases
